Explanation:

bitwise AND requires all bits in a position x to be 1, so in the result bit x is 1. So for every bit going from bit with largest value to smallest value:1. Count how many zeros2. If we have enough operations to make them one (i.e. k >= zeros_count), then we convert it and we add to the result that bit
